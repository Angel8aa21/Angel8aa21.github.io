## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 7, part 1

I love this lab because, to me, it's one of those that feels like a “real” problem, all logically experiencing coding how it will be in the future. I like the way the problem keeps me thinking of different conditions, edge cases such as changes in the parking restrictions depending on the day of the week and the time of the day. It's not about coding alone; but involves translating some real-life situations into clear, logical rules a computer can handle. I appreciate the fact that, thought of it, I have instantaneous feedback while working with my code functions and particularly handle all sorts of situations accurately. It will be satisfying to see the program make decisions based on specific criteria such as restricted parking on certain days and hours. This lab gives me an opportunity to apply what i have learned in a practical manner, while slo testing my problem-solving skills in a challenging yet rewarding manner.

Lab 4, part 1

This is one of my favorite labs. It allows me to work in real-world conversion in a pretty hands-on way. I like how this lab combines some simple arithmetic with user input, which makes it extra satisfying to see immediate results. The logic of the milliliters converting to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups was pretty straightforward, though it requires an attention to detail that will keep me hooked. I like that the program allows me to immediately apply functions in a real life world-scenario setting, reinforcing how to write and utilize functions to perform conversions. It is also rewarding to have the program run seamlessly, taking one input and converting it into various other units of measure, then presenting the output in an easy-to-read, end-user-friendly fashion. This lab provides me with a feeling of accomplishment, knowing that basic principles of programming are applied to something useful and quite easy to understand.

Lab 9, part 2

This lab is one of my favorites because it lets me work with a variety of programming concepts in a straightforward way. I enjoy how it involves reading data from a file, taking user input, and checking for errors, all while creating a simple guessing game. It is not difficult to follow and I find the challenge in carefully reading from a file and preparing for any eventualities such as bad input or malformed file. The game is fun in its own right, and getting instant feedback in the form of the program's output because of a user’s guess is gratifying. It's just a great way to practice the important skills, like file handling and conditionals, on a pretty practica; and interactive program
